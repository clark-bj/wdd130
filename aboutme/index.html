    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Brian Clark</h2>
    <h2>Call me: Brian</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Brian Clark. I live in American Fork, Utah. I am a husband, and father of 5 children ages 26 to 16 (One Boy, Four Girls). I have been an IT professional for over twenty five yeas. While it has beena long time, it has always been on the operations side. Though I have a Bachelor's in Business, IT Management, I am excited to get into Web and Software Development. That is the path that I am going down now, in order to increase my skills, refresh myself, and look at some potential business ideas I have.</p>
    <p>Originally from the Pacific Northwest, I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my entire life. Currently, I am serving as the First Counselor in our Elder's Quorum Presidency.</p>
    <p>I love BYU sports! From Football to our nationally ranked #1 Women's Soccer team. Go Gals! I also love taking walks and hiking with my family. I'm also very much into technology. I consider myself a "technophile", or someone who loves tech things. Particularly around computers, audio/visual, and am a closet gear head (cars).</p>
    <p>I currently work for a large technology company, managing operations engineers. We are seeing new technologies around our web offerings that have inspired me to dig into development, but more importantly, I feel that I have been directed to pursue greater education for myself. I know the Lord is in our daily lives, if we will seek his aid, and even at this stage in my career, I feel like this is a great step</p>
    <p>I look forward to getting to know and working with you all through this course!</p>
